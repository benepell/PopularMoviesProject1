# Popular Movies

Here is a simple and colorful android app which I made for "Android Developer Nanodegree" - Project 1.


## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover the movies most popular or the most rated 
* Read reviews 

## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to:
    ```
    app/build.gradle ... $MOVIE_DB_API_KEY
    ```
